GPS 1.1 Version Control and Git

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

All of it.  Using the Command Line and Git was a tedious learning experience for me.  It wasn't so much a matter of knowing the commands as it was understanding the workflow. Particularly challenging was the branching concepts.  More often than not, I would  find that I had a merge conflict after pushing to the remote.  I am getting better at noticing the pitfalls before they occur.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Fetching and Merging.  Our Guide was able to elaborate on this concept during our session.

What questions did you ask your pair and Guide?

Being that this was the first week, most of the challenge was following  the workflow as described in the challenge.  I was strictly the navigator in the challenge as my terminal was down due to technical issues. The directives in the challenge were pretty straightforward and easy to follow.  Saying that, there were edits that had to be made per the challenge that required updated "commits."

My pair and I had a pretty smooth back and forth regarding the execution of this challenge.  We were both good in communicating with each other over each directive.

There was some discussion with our Guide over the nuances of a Fetch and Merge.

What still confuses you about Git?

I still have some issues with keeping my branches organized for a seamless Merge process.  It is getting better...

How was your first experience of pairing in Git?

I enjoyed the pairing interaction immensely.  For me, it helped me to understand the nuances of Git to work on it with a partner.  Where you don't see something, or you don't know how to execute something, the other person might.  And vice versa.  It allows for more expediancy in coding a challenge versus getting stuck on challenge when working solo.
